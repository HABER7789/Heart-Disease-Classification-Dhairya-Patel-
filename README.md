# Heart-Disease-Classification-Dhairya-Patel-
Creation of a Machine Learning model using Keras for classification of heart diseases.
- The project involves preparing the imported dataset that will be feeded to the machine learning models.
- Extensive Data Analysis and Visualization has been carried out on the Cleveland Dataset, which involves detecting, imputing or replacing the missing values in the dataset, as well as graphical represenation of the available data.
- Training and Testing has been done in the project using sklearn library.
- Further, neural network model is built and trained using sci-kit learn and keras library and ompitmized using Adam optimizer.
- The project has represented the respective accuracy and confusion matrix for the keras model that has been built.
